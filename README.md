Hi! Welcome to my mini python project!
This repo contains three interesting mini Python projects:

* The first one can transfer any 'open street map' source file into a jpeg picture. 
* The second one can parse IMDB rating file,extract movie name, year, ratings and more, 
output interesting results into XML, HTML or CSV format. 
* The third one can parse any Amazon book website source file and select interesting 
information such as authors, prices, ISBN, recommendations,comments.
