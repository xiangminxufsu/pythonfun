Hi! Welcome to my mini python project!

This repo contains three interesting mini Python projects. 

The first one can transfer any 'open street map' source file into a jpeg picture. 

The second one can parse IMDB rating file and output interesting results into XML, HTML or CSV format. 

The third one can parse any Amazon book web source file and select interesting information such as authors, prices, ISBN, recommendations.
