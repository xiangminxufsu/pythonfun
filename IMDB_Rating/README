This program includes 3 files: imdb_ratings.py, format.py, test_imdb_ratings.py. imdb_ratings.py contains a movie class parsing the input file and main function. format.py contains classes printing in different format (csv,xml,html). test_imdb_ratings.py test the condition function.

According to the requirement,the episode name(if any) is added to the title, so the title could be very long...

Duplicated movies are removed. The condition is that two movies are the same if they have same name. They might have different ratings,like the example below:

0000001222  284673   8.1  How to Train Your Dragon (2010)
0000001222  284673   8.2  How to Train Your Dragon (2010)

Html output as source code is tested and it works,though the code looks ugly.
