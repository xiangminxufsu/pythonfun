This book is a much more readable text, by far.  I think that others here have broken down the areas covered quite well; so I\'ll just give a stream of consciousness version of what I liked about the book.It gives the subject matter with from a need to know standpoint.  It also gives you real world examples of how the author has had to utilize algorithms not just to implement a particular solution, but to also optimize existing solutions.  Although it doesn\'t give the hardcore theoretical breakdowns in Cormen\'s text, don\'t think that the subject matter is presented in a lightweight format.  You will still be given some level of mathematical proof for some algorithms and data structure optimizations.Although less terse than the typical text on Algorithms, it doesn\'t try too hard to be cute and quirky.  The humor is well placed and not too overbearing.Though less academic than "Introduction To Algorithms", this ain\'t the book to pickup to learn about coding algorithms for a quick study prior to an interview.  However, if you\'re planning to get ready for interviews maybe a few months down the road...go for it!A caveat...I got the Kindle version for the Android, which is none too forgiving when it comes to images.

Buy the physical book, not the Kindle edition, don\'t make my mistake!For example, take a look at the "ClosestPair(P)" algorithm described on p7 of the hardcover edition, see the preview http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0 . Compare that to the same algorithm shown in the Kindle edition: http://www.amazon.com/The-Algorithm-Design-Manual-ebook/dp/B0016H523Q/ref=tmm_kin_title_0 .

By the time he died, the pages of his copy were stained and dusted with flour from being constantly used in his kitchen.Why did he like it so much? Because not only did it have great recipes, it also explored the basic ingredients and methods and told interesting stories about cooking.That\'s why "The Algorithm Design Manual" could be called "The Joy of Algorithms." Not only has it become my "goto" book for finding the right algorithmic approach to a problem, it is a joy to read with Skiena\'s "war stories" and his lively writing style.Just like my Dad\'s "The Joy of Cooking" was never far from his stove, "The Algorithm Design Manual" will never be far from my computer.\n', 4: u'\n  This book was recommended to me by a member of a large company that starts with G and rhymes with noodle...He explained that it "the best" for learning algorithmns. Being out of university for many years, and being a mechanical/software engineer vs a computer scientist, I needed something to refresh my memory and teach me what I did not know about algorithms.So the good first:1. I was able to read (almost, see point 4) the whole book (663 actual pages to read) in 5 nights (at 4-5 hours per night), so it is good if you need the knowledge in a rush.2. Most of the knowledge is quite comprehensible. Specifically the basic concepts: Big-O notation, logarithmic behaviour, data structures, graph traversal.3. The second part of the book is more like a reference, so if you have a problem to solve, you can go there and use that to direct you to the appropriate algorithms.4. I did not read the "war stories", lack of time and lack of interest. Those are where the author tells us his brave battles against the algorithms.The Bad:1. Some topics are not explained clear enough: I could NOT understand the important sorts (Quick, Merge, Heap) just by reading the book. I tried as hard as I could, but only when I went to "the net", read it again, and actually coded the things myself + going line by line with the debugeer I finally understood them.2. The code samples actually make function calls to functions that are not written there. You are left hangin\' - what do we do now?3. Trees: Splay trees, black red trees, AVL trees, B-Trees and tries - they are barely mentioned or given a few words. Not enough, in my humble opinion.4. Weighted graph problems: Either the topic is for genius level only, or I am an idiot, or the explanation was horrible. Chose any two... Didn\'t understand anything.Well, hope I didn\'t bore you too much.
